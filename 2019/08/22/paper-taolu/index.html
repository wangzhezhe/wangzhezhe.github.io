        <p>整理一些所谓的做research些论文的套路。</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>其实所谓的套路就是所谓的科学的思维方法，凭经验和感觉在scentific的方面可能不是很适用，最起码是在完善idea的过程中，需要用到科学的思维方法。</p>
<h3 id="when-it-is-hard-to-move-forward"><a href="#when-it-is-hard-to-move-forward" class="headerlink" title="when it is hard to move forward"></a>when it is hard to move forward</h3><p>some times, it is hard to think about the reaesch idea, at this point, instead of torturing yourself, it is better to use some methods to guide yourself to moveforward.</p>
<p>what is the research problem or the goal you want to target, such as metric</p>
<p>what is the context such as the entity you want to research or target</p>
<p>what is the current research status (it is highly possible there are some related works, you do not need to worry too much if your idea overlaps with other people’s idea)</p>
<p>what is the assumptions or the conditions for other people’s method, basically no solutions can solve every problems or suitable for every conditions.</p>
<p>you may dive into related works carefully and see what are there conditions or assumptions, they may not discuss these things too much some times, when you could answer when this method is suitable to solve this problem, it is a good point that you could try to provide other solutions with other conditions.</p>
<p>when consider about the conditions, pay attention to some commonly used methods such as the how to classify one thing. (maybe find just search the key word “assume” or “require”)</p>
<p>you may find some small ideas or minor points that you can improve, do not let it go, and many a little makes a mickle，new ideas can be presented during this process.</p>
<h3 id="control-experiments"><a href="#control-experiments" class="headerlink" title="control experiments"></a>control experiments</h3><p>这个方法在自然科学，或者是data science中似乎用的更多一些，就是对于原理还比较黑盒的时候，比较经典的例子就是发现坏血病和维生素C有关的例子，把病人分成多组，然后每个组使用不同的方法进行处理，最后发现输入与结果的关联性。</p>
<h3 id="evaluation"><a href="#evaluation" class="headerlink" title="evaluation"></a>evaluation</h3><p>做一个事情解决一个问题一共有 a b c d e 几种类似的方式，这些方式在某些情况下这个好，在某些情况下那个好。影响好坏的parameter都有哪些然后做实验来evaluate，体现出不同，然后讨论那些不够好的地方，看看怎么能够优化的更好，比如利用现有的技术手段，怎么能进一步减少overhead。似乎对于刚刚接触某个领域，想发现一些隐藏着的问题的时候，这个方法比较有效。</p>
<h3 id="a-tip-about-the-results-discussion"><a href="#a-tip-about-the-results-discussion" class="headerlink" title="a tip about the results discussion"></a>a tip about the results discussion</h3><p>As with any discussion about plots, we may use the handy mnemonic “WALTER” to make sure your readers understand the plot: a) What is the plot and Why it is important? b) Axes. c) Labels. d) Trends. e) Exceptions. f) Recap. Although it may looks cliched to follow particular rules to write paper, but at least for the first version of the paper, following particular rules are necessary, you could make sure that every details are clearly explained. Then for the second version, you may merge and adjust sequences of these key pieceses and make the work more readable.</p>
<h3 id="faster-higher-and-stronger"><a href="#faster-higher-and-stronger" class="headerlink" title="faster, higher and stronger"></a>faster, higher and stronger</h3><p>直接的contribution，这个事情可以怎样把原来的问题解决的更好，首先已经明确了做一个事情的方式或者解决一个问题的方法是什么。这种类型的paper往往是比较大的contribution或者是突破性的成果，这个事情解决了一个原来没有解决的问题。具体进行evaluation的时候就是两组比较，没有使用这个方法和有使用这个方法的时候各是什么样的，然后突出了使用这个方法之后的metric的优越性。</p>
<p>当然也有一些trick，比如得到了独一无二的数据或者access到别人无法使用的机器资源等等。</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-good-idea-or-novelty"><a href="#what-is-the-good-idea-or-novelty" class="headerlink" title="what is the good idea or novelty"></a>what is the good idea or novelty</h3><p>别人不知道的，非局部的incremental的，解决方法能适用于一类问题的，并非单纯的A+B的问题。</p>
<h3 id="motivation-tool-vs-goal"><a href="#motivation-tool-vs-goal" class="headerlink" title="motivation, tool vs goal"></a>motivation, tool vs goal</h3><p>some times it is hard to detect if an idea is deserved to do, or even if it is right. The secure way is to find a similar paper, maybe it used same methods for differnet data or different domain, maybe it focuse on similar problems but the methods can be improved further. At least there are some research value in this way. If you are lucky, what you want to do is the future step of similar work or sth that previous paper ignored, that might be easier to find the research motivation by this way.</p>
<p>A dangerous case is confuse the tool and the goal, sometimes you just think s perticular methods is good and dive into it a lot but lose the overall picure, that is dangerous. Always ask your self what is the metric, evaluation goal and the benifits for the whole picture, if the answer is clear, you may at the right direaction and have a good motivation. Otherwise, you may just try to recreate a tire with a different shape!!!</p>
<p>Even in a ten pages paper, the implementation is just around one page, the more important thing is the motivation, methods, evaluation. You may just need to describe some key points of the implementation even if you puts lots of effots here for the most of the time.</p>
<h3 id="discuss-and-motivation"><a href="#discuss-and-motivation" class="headerlink" title="discuss and motivation"></a>discuss and motivation</h3><p>sometimes, it is important to get feedbacks from colleagues. You may have different ideas here, before discussing, always try to void yourself and think what other people’s idea are right, then follow their thoughts and go through it by your logics, listen to the full expression from the other people and then you may get more in this case and the expression my get more effective, do not say right or wrong for other people’s idea, just by asking particular questions if you think a particular question is wrong. People may willing to provide more feedbacks for you in this case. and you may find there are more places that can be improved in your work. It is important to make sure you understand people’s idea instead of just saying that other people’s ideas are incorrect inadvance.</p>
<h3 id="from-the-synthetic-or-simulated-env-to-the-real-project"><a href="#from-the-synthetic-or-simulated-env-to-the-real-project" class="headerlink" title="from the synthetic or simulated env to the real project"></a>from the synthetic or simulated env to the real project</h3><p>The idea is motivated by the area such as the quantumn computing, even though the state of art quantum computer can process less than hundreds of qubit, but the new algorithm that use thousands of qubit can be created and applied by the <strong>synthetic case</strong> or <strong>simulated env</strong>. The simulated env can show that if this ideas work in an ideal env, some times it does not work even for the ideal case, that is a good try since you avoid the wrong direaction with the small cost, after play with the simulated env, there might be better ideas, and that is the benifits of the simulated env. The ideas of using simulated env may similar with writting the test case or integratred testing for the projects, these kind of tests can help you to find out the potential errors in a more efficient way. Then from the simulated or synthetic case to the workable example or project, you may need this depedency or that capabilities, these things may take lots of time to do, then you could show this to your boss that what you are doing is meaningful based on the simulated or synthetic case. This could release your pressure when you are doing the long time work<br>and convince your both and yourself. </p>
<h3 id="strucutre-of-related-works-how-to-learn-and-extend-the-knowledge-in-a-systematical-way"><a href="#strucutre-of-related-works-how-to-learn-and-extend-the-knowledge-in-a-systematical-way" class="headerlink" title="strucutre of related works, how to learn and extend the knowledge in a systematical way"></a>strucutre of related works, how to learn and extend the knowledge in a systematical way</h3><p>when list the related work, the good practice is try to find the clues of the works instead of just describing the content of the work. One tricky point is that we need to find the knowledge graph hidden behind the related works. By realing lots of related works, we find that clue, and then use that clues, we can show that if the current works are enough and we can easy to extend it and get new direactions. This is also a good strategy to have a good motivation.</p>
<p>How to get a clue is imporant, the idea here is how to use the classification. When we see the structure of the related works, one simple way is to say if wen can classify this thing. When we start to classify it, we can start to get the new knowledge.</p>
<p>Another way is that, try to put your target in the different clues or goals (typically A+B method to generate new things). It will become a trick to generate more knowledge. For example, you focuse on a system that process the data, the common classification for this system is producer, consumer. This is the different part of constructing this thing. Then maybe you want it becomes an adaotive system, and there are some classifications for the adaptive system to describe one thing. Such as adaptive goal, adaptive policies and adaptive mechanisms. Then you have 2 dimentions to descirbe this thing, and there is a 3 time 2 configuration space that you can use to describe related works. You may find that contents discribed in one paper may locate in multiple entries, by this way, you may find that some entris are not well explored. Then this is a good opportunity to go to the next step.</p>
<p>Basically, you use different dimentions to describe one target, and for a particular dimention, there are some discrete values that can be typical types of this dimention. Figure out how it works in each dimention is the typical process of learn this thing, then you may create more discrete values, this is a kind of contribution to extend the knowledge. Another way is to combine different dimentions together, this is a more simple way to extend the entry, for dimetion a there is classification [a1,a2], for dimention b, there is classification [b1,b2,b3], then you just look at the system from the perspective of the a1,b1; a1,b2; a1,b3…</p>
<h3 id="The-BFS-and-DFS-to-describe-the-background-knowledge"><a href="#The-BFS-and-DFS-to-describe-the-background-knowledge" class="headerlink" title="The BFS and DFS to describe the background knowledge"></a>The BFS and DFS to describe the background knowledge</h3><p>When we talking about the background and the motivation part of a workflow, both BFS and DFS is important strategy to describe the knowledge tree. We may easy to neglect the BFS part. For example, in the context A, there is a problem P, there are several methods, such as M1, M2, M3 to solve it, this paper improve the performance for M1. For this case, we my easily neglect the A2, A3… P2 P3… during the description. Although we may not dive into details for thses cases, but it is also worth to describe them when we start to introduce the A and P, this can make the description progress in a more systamatical way and it is also easy for reader to locate what you have done in this work. Sometimes it is important to let other people’s know the scope or this work compared with how you actually do it. Since most of the methods are common or easy undersanding or a minor improvements. People may just need to make sure what you do make sense and the results make sense, that is enough for the basic level of the paper. For the novelty, it is sth we expect but not often have</p>
<p>It might also a good practice to make sure you understand the problem clearly by pushing your self describe things in this way. An interesting analogy is to consider the generative and the discriminative model used in the machine learning scope. When we consider one thing in the generative way, basically we are doing the DFS and shape the distribution step by step and refine it continuously. But to some extend, we may find it is not worth to continue shape the description of this thing, we may tend to use the discriminative method to consider the distinction between this thing and other things. Basicslly, when we try to do the distinction, we use the BFS method and when we try to describe the properties of sth, we use the generative model. Without the clear defination about the sample space, it is really hard to describe sth clearly and make it a unique thing in definatino. For example, let’s say we want to define a person, it is hard to describe it clearly since there are all kinds of overlapping between different aspacets of a person, even using all biological characteristic, there are probabilitis of the twins. We may use the generative model to limit the description into a particular scope, and then, use the discriminative model to do that. This might be a more economic way. Basically in the paper, the last point is the contribution or research values. you could describe what is difference between your work and other works that try to solve similar tasks. Your work might be better in this case and other work might be better in that case etc.</p>
<h3 id="model-approach-and-error-analysis"><a href="#model-approach-and-error-analysis" class="headerlink" title="model approach and error analysis"></a>model approach and error analysis</h3><p>one important thing is about the disucssion of the reaults in the related works. for example, you build sth. like a model and get results, the reviewer or the reader may want to see your observation and the thoughts about these observation. Namely, why it is like this. there is a tradeoff about how much content and efforts that describe the implementation details and analysing the resutls. Basically, both of these two things are important, but the analysing is more imporant, especially during the presentation. Since you may take several days to make sth work, in the presentation, it is just a sentences. But for analysing, you could discuss a lot.</p>
<p>error dicussion is sth that is easy to be neglected especially for the work that focus on a particular system or framework. One kind of paper is to dicuss a framework and then analysis the performance for key metric such as scalability, IO or throughoutput and so on, and you may say that your work outperform the state of the art case. </p>
<p>But I had few chance to do the paper like that. more works I worked on is to present a model and say we want to evaluate or compare sth, then use this as the motivation of developing particular framework (our implementation), and then say this framework works well based on model. This is kind of mixing the model and the framework developing together. Actually this is a little bit hard, at one aspect, you need to show that the framework is good for performance such as scale and key metric. At another aspect the model approach should be presneted. Although neither aspects are really strong (it is hard to output a pure theoritical paper or a pure system paper), but at least, there are enough content to be published.</p>
<p>I may have some knowledge about the framework evaluation, such as varying the configuration and checking the performance, but few knowledge about the model evaluation.</p>
<p>there should be a disctinction between the model and the policy or algorithm<br>for model, the metric such as error need to be added into the evaluation for the model evaluation, this is sth that may be neglected. We may provide an model (abstraction of sth), then we may build a policy based on this model, then we may use these policies direactly, the unconvinced part of this operation is the error of the model itself. We may first figure out the requirments of the model and the limitation of the model, and figure out what are the errors that influenmce the model, and then we can move to the next step to say how to make the policy and model more accurate for representing and anticipating the actual problem.</p>
<p>Let’s to an simple example, if you want to line up several kids efficiently, the first is to abstract kids as a number, namelay the height, although there are multiple other aspects, but they can be neglected in this problem. Then we can use the particular policies such as quick sort algorithm to do it. But for the model adpects, if we do not use the real time height of the kids, but use the data recorded one years ago for every kids, the reaults might be inaccurate. The results might also be influenced based on inacurate measurement of the model process.</p>
